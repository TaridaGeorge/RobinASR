# RobinASR - Work in progress...

This repository contains an Automatic Speech Recognition System for the Romanian language that uses the DeepSpeech2 architecture.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank [Sean Narnen](https://github.com/SeanNaren) for making his DeepSpeech2 implementation publicly-available. We used a lot of his code in our implementation.
